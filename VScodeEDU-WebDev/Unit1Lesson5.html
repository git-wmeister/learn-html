            It starts to be somekind of <b>boring bold</b> to write this <strong>strong</strong> text.
    		But we add some <i>italic</i> and <em>emphased</em> text to make it more interesting. 
            Luckywise we can also use <u>underline</u> and <ins>inserted</ins> text. 
            With GitHub we can also use <del>deleted</del> text and <ins>inserted</ins> text easily.

            <b>HTML</b> is a <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">markup language</abbr> used to create web pages.

            Now I add some <mark>marked</mark> text. 
            <br>
            Than I add some <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> text. 
            <br> 
            This should be a <small>small</small> text and this should be a <big>big</big> text.
            <br>
            This is a <cite>citation</cite> and this is a <code>code</code> text.
            With <kbd>keyboard</kbd> and <samp>sample</samp> text we can also play and end with <var>variables</var> our html format journey. Thankfuly we can also use <pre>preformatted</pre> text and <blockquote>blockquotes</blockquote> to make our text more readable.
            Hopefully GitHub will end our journey with <q>quotes</q> and <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">abbreviations</abbr>.
            I have to say thank you GitHub for this <dfn>definition</dfn> and <address>address</address> to the world and your sup
